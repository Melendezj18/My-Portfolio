            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <h3>Jose Melendez</h3>
            <p>I am a Software Engineer and passionate lifelong learner with a love for coding. My abundant patience,
                strong problem-solving abilities, and eagerness to learn have consistently enabled me to bridge gaps
                within teams and quickly adapt to new situations. My previous experience as a driver for three years has
                honed my ability to meet tight deadlines and perform effectively under pressure. Additionally, my
                participation in track and various extracurricular groups has cultivated my interpersonal skills, making
                me a friendly team player who can defuse tense situations and approach problems from diverse
                perspectives to identify and pivot between various problem-solving strategies. Through facing and
                overcoming numerous challenges, I've developed a steadfast determination that drives me towards success.
